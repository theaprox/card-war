# Card game "War" in Python

## Project description

Create a card game **War** (aka. **Battle** in the UK) using **python**.

The program MUST adhere to **OOP** _(Object-Oriented Programming)_ and **SRP** _(Single Responsibility Principle)_ programming principles.

> [!NOTE]
> Game logic for German variant [Bettelmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bettelmann)
>
> -   Only 2-player game.
> -   Use 32-card deck **7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K, A** of **♠️, ♦️, ♣️, ♥️**.
> -   Cards rank in their natural order _(high -> low)_ **A, K, Q, J, 10, 9,...**.
> -   Each player starts with 16 cards (face down).
> -   Players reveal cards at the same time and the higher card wins, if the cards are equal players draw again. Winner takes all cards and puts them aside.
> -   Player with the most cards wins.

## Collaboration instructions

#### 1. Go to `<your project directory>` and open a terminal _(cmd, shell, bash...)_

#### 2. Clone `dev` branch from git repository using:

```bash
git clone -b dev --single-branch https://github.com/theaprox/card-war.git
```

This will create a new folder in your project directory called "card-war".

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You'll need to create a new branch for each "issue" in [issues](https://github.com/theaprox/card-war/issues)
>
> **EXAMPLE:**
> To work on "issue #2" you'd need to create an "issues/2-deck-module" branch.

#### 3. Work on the dedicated branch

-   **step 1:** Asign yourself or ask to be asigned to an open/todo ticket before starting any work.

-   **step 2:** Develop a feature/issue on your dedicated branch and publish it (the branch) to git repo

-   **step 3:** Create a _Pull Request_ asking to merge your `issue...` branch to `dev`.
    > [!CAUTION]
    > You **DO NOT** need to review, fix or confirm PR requests.

#### 4. Completion

Mark a ☑️ for each segment/step complete in the _issue_ you work on. If you managed to resolve an entire ticket - mark it with `done` in the project view.

Once done (your the hour of programming is over) - go through with a 5-10 min stand-up regarding your work.
